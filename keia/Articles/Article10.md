The **"Principle of Revealed Preference"** has traditionally been regarded as fundamental in evaluating social welfare in collective decision-making scenarios, where agents are assumed to make rational and consistent choices. Within this framework, careful observation of an individual's choices allows for the deduction of their preferences and, consequently, inferences about their welfare.

The foundational postulate of traditional welfare economics posits that preferences are defined over specific sets of choices or allocations, with behavioral anomalies emerging as the domain of preferences expands. These anomalies are particularly evident when individuals face choices between immediate gratification and future rewards.

**Gul and Pesendorfer (2004)'** argue that explaining these anomalics requires recognizing that an individual's preferences extend beyond the allocation of goods at a given moment to include their preferences for the set of future choices available. In other words, it is essential to consider not only immediate choices but also how individuals foel about the options they will have in the future. An individual may then make decisions that appcar irrational in the short term but are justifiable when viewed through the lens of their "reference-dependent" preferences.

The concept of **reference-dependent preferences** extends the idca of revealed preferences, providing a framework to rationalize seemingly irrational individual choices. Preferences are influenced not only by what an individual experiences but also by how these experiences compare to a reference point.

In the financial context, this implies that individuals may not make decisions based solely on their absolute wealth but rather on changes in wealth relative to their reference point. This understanding challenges the assumption of lincarity (or symmetry) in utility functions, replacing it with an **asymmetric utility curve**, where an individual's welfare is not equally influenced by gains and losses.

According to Gul and Pesendorfer, individuals place greater value on avoiding losses than on acquiring equivalent gains. This asymmetry has implications for how people perceive risk and make financial decisions. In the context of an asymmetric utility curve:

1) When an individual gains relative to their referenoe point, the incremental utility diminishes as the gain
increases. In other words, the benefit of additional resources decreases progressively.

2) When an individual experiences a loss relative to their reference point, utility declines more sharply as the loss intensifies. Thus, the pain from losses outweighs the pleasure derived from equivalent gains.

This analysis not only describes the psychological behavior of individuals regarding gains and losses but also has practical implications for how people make economic and financial decisions, driven by emotions and perceptions that go beyond rational calculations.

For an in-depth exploration of these themes and their practical implications, refer to the full paper: **The Dark Side of Finance: Unveiling Behavioral Biases** (Discussion Paper Built on Foundational Studies and Insights).
