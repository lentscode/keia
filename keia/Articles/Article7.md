Human behavior in consumption is often irrational and difficult to explain logically. Many consumer choices are influenced by emotional, psychological, and social factors that lie beneath the surface of conscious thought. This behavior is driven by three main layers of motivation: conscious, subconscious, and unconscious.

According to Freud’s theory, much of human behavior is governed by unconscious forces, which he compared to an iceberg—only a small part of the psyche is visible (conscious), while the majority remains hidden (unconscious). This suggests that many consumer behaviors are shaped by unconscious desires and impulses that consumers themselves may not recognize. 
For instance, people may buy certain products or choose specific brands based on deep emotional needs or cultural conditioning, rather than purely rational reasons.

## Conscious, Subconscious, and Unconscious Purchases

Consumer purchases can be divided into three categories based on the level of awareness of the underlying motivations:

1) Conscious Purchases: These are based on rational, deliberate decisions, where the consumer is fully aware of their needs and motivations. For instance, buying an umbrella when it’s raining is a conscious decision made after evaluating the need for protection from the weather.
2) Subconscious Purchases: These purchases are influenced by cultural or societal factors that the individual may not be fully aware of. For example, a bank employee may choose a formal suit or business attire, unconsciously avoiding clothing that might seem inappropriate for the workplace (like sandals or casual clothes). This behavior is influenced by social norms and the individual’s awareness of how others will perceive them.
3) Unconscious Purchases: These are driven by deeper, primal impulses, such as sexual or biological desires. A young man who goes to the gym to improve his physical appearance may be unknowingly driven by a desire to increase his reproductive attractiveness, a motive rooted in instinct rather than rational thought.

While conscious motivations can be linked to rational, logical purchases, subconscious and unconscious motivations are driven by deeper, sometimes irrational forces. 
Exploring the unconscious realm of human behavior may make some uncomfortable, especially when considering the animalistic impulses that drive many decisions. However, these factors are a key component in consumer behavior, and understanding them is crucial for effective marketing strategies.

In conclusion, human consumption is not solely based on rational decision-making; it is shaped by a complex interplay of conscious, subconscious, and unconscious forces. Marketers who understand this dynamic can better anticipate consumer behavior and tap into deeper, often hidden, motivations.
