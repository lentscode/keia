It's 2024 and we find ourselves at the edge of consumerism: doing shopping is easy like it never was before, with the rise of e-commerce in the last years, and people want to spend their money like they never did before.
However, buyers often experience serious hardship because their economic and financial situation, with big impact on their happiness and stress levels.

## The insights

In 2020, the company Thrive Global asked about 3,000 U.S. adult cityzens a [survey](https://community.thriveglobal.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Thriving-Wallet-Research-Insights-Report.pdf) to know more about the financial condition of people in the contemporary age. They also asked questions about the emotional impact of economics on their lives, to better understand how the habit of spending affects people's private lives.

The first insights is about the correlation between the ability to spend intelligently and overall well-being: people who are more skilled in saving their money and not buying not useful stuff experience roughly 1.85 times more well-being than people who don't treat their money with particular care. This underlines the gigantic impact that saving and smart spending has on our lives.

Furthermore, most people are quietly pessimistic about their financial difficulties: about 65% feel that are getting to a point where recovering from these conditions will no more be possible, and 40% wish they could have a "fresh" financial start. Less than 25% are optimistic with their financial future. 
More dramaticaly, about 90% of people agree that their financial difficulties impact negatively on their stress levels, limiting also in most cases their ability to enjoy everyday life.

More than one third of people experience negative impacts on their sleep quality too, with about 25% of these individuals suffering from insomnia, broken sleep, nightmares, etc.
