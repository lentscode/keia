One of the biggest barriers to adopting sustainable spending habits is the accessibility of sustainable products. Brands that position themselves as ethical or environmentally friendly often come with a higher price tag. 
As a result, the higher a consumer's income, the more likely they are to embrace a sustainable lifestyle.

A study conducted in the UK revealed that households with an annual income above £50,000 were significantly more likely to engage in sustainable shopping practices. 
This highlights the clear correlation between income level and the ability to afford sustainable products. Cost is a major factor preventing many consumers from making sustainable choices.

Even if people desire to shop with eco-conscious brands, they often feel that these products are out of their financial reach. This financial barrier is a key reason why many individuals do not purchase from more sustainable brands, despite their intention to do so. 
In essence, while there is a growing awareness and desire for sustainable alternatives, affordability remains a significant challenge that prevents widespread adoption of sustainable spending habits.

For a more sustainable future, addressing this accessibility issue—by making ethical and eco-friendly products more affordable and accessible to a wider range of consumers—will be crucial in encouraging broader adoption of sustainable shopping behaviors.
