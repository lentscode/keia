In economics, goods can be categorized as either necessities or luxuries based on how their demand responds to changes in income. The degree to which the quantity demanded changes in response to an increase in income determines whether a good is considered essential or non-essential. 
This relationship is often quantified using income elasticity of demand, a measure that helps classify goods into these two categories.

## Luxuries: Goods with High Income Elasticity

A luxury good is characterized by a high income elasticity of demand. This means that when a consumer's income rises, their demand for luxury items increases by a higher percentage than the income increase itself. In other words, the quantity demanded grows more than proportionally as income grows. 
For example, if income increases by 10%, the demand for luxury goods (such as vacations or designer clothing) might increase by 15% or more.

The income elasticity of demand for luxury goods is greater than 1. These are typically non-essential goods, where consumer choices are heavily influenced by personal preferences, status, and lifestyle. 
Since they are not necessary for basic survival, luxury goods are often considered discretionary purchases, made when consumers have more disposable income.

## Necessities: Goods with Low Income Elasticity

On the other hand, necessities are goods essential for everyday life, such as food, fuel, and medicines. The demand for necessities does increase as income rises, but the increase is less than proportional to the rise in income. 
For instance, if a consumer's income increases by 10%, their demand for basic goods might only rise by 5%.
The income elasticity of demand for necessities lies between 0 and 1. These goods are crucial for maintaining a basic standard of living, so even though people may buy more of them as they become wealthier, the increase in quantity demanded is not as dramatic as for luxury items. 
Necessities are typically non-discretionary and tend to make up a larger share of the budget for lower-income households, though this share decreases as income grows.

## Key Takeaways

- Luxury goods: Have an income elasticity greater than 1. Their demand increases more than proportionally as income rises.
- Necessity goods: Have an income elasticity between 0 and 1. Their demand increases, but less than proportionally as income rises.

This distinction is crucial for understanding consumer behavior and helps businesses, policymakers, and economists predict how demand will change in response to shifts in income levels across different segments of the population.
